                PrettyGoodPasswords is a web application using Google App Engine.
                Users can read & write password entries safely and securely.
                Entries are stored in App Engine (NoSQL) High Replication Datastore (HRD).
            </p>
            <p>
                No data is stored in the clear. We transform your master password with a mathematical hash, called
                PBKDF2, and store the result. Each time you enter your master password, check that the transformation
                results in the same value. Thus we don't
                save and can't recover your master password. Working backwards to discover your password from this hash
                can be difficult. Here's a discussion on
                <a href="http://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/18173/how-long-does-it-take-to-crack-pbkdf2">how long
                    to brute force PBKDF2.</a>
                In general, it can depend on the quality of your master password. We will assist you to create a strong
                master password.

            <p><b>But make no mistake, a determined
                attacker with ASICs or FPGAs will be able to brute force your password, given access to the data.</b>
                This site is not recommended for those living in an oppressive regime.
                Or those who need an advanced level of security.
                It is better to choose a solution which manages your cryptographic keys locally.
            </p>
            <p>How do we protect your stored password entries?
                An ephemeral private key is generated from PBKDF2 using the master password+salt and
                100000 iterations. PBKDF2, which stands for Password-Based Key Derivation Function, version 2. If you
                are curious how it works
                you can peruse <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2898#section-5.2">section 5.2 of RFC 2898</a>.
                All site, username, password, and note data is AES encoded with that private key.
                The key exists transitionally in a secure, server side session and is discarded when the user logs out
                or time expires.
            </p>
            <p>
                This means that there is no facility to recover lost master passwords.
                We can not reset your password without loss of all your data.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your account will lock after 5 failed attempts to login. An email will be sent with a special
                unlock code. This will slow down illicit entry, and make remote brute forcing your password intractable.
            </p>

            <p>
                You can greatly increase the security of your passwords by adding two factor authentication to your
                google account.
                Thereafter, you need to do an extra layer of authentication only for new devices.
            </p>
            <p>
                Always take care when accessing this on a public computer. Preferably, do not. And do not use two factor
                to authenticate a public device.
